jProcess
========

Java library for cross-platform retrieval of information on running processes.

Currently in a POC phase for linux only. Very rough build working.

Hope to support -

Linux
Windows
Solaris
Mac
Unix

This would provide detailed information on processes, as an alternative to parsing the result of running a env-specific process executable yourself.
